# sqelp --- an squeue helper developed by Rob Leach
# =================================================

# =================================================
# So I customized the output of squeue in an alias 
# the other day and have experienced some infor-
# mation overload.  So I numerically sorted the 
# output and wrote a quick script to only print 
# information in rows when it changes from job to 
# job, otherwise if the information in a column is 
# the same from row to row, it prints a double-quote.  
# It also prints a full line every 32 rows (based on 
# my preferred terminal height).  I find it's a lot 
# easier to visually digest - for me anyway.  I 
# thought I would share the alias & helper script 
# (which is basically a perl-script-one-liner I 
# saved in a file).  It'll work on whatever squeue 
# command you use.
